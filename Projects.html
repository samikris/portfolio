       <h2>Entrepreneurship Project - Project Recycle (POE)</h2>
       <h3>5/4/22 - 5/18/22</h3>

        <p>The 2022 Entrepreneurship Project is a major project done by all of the engineering and CS students at DHS. This year, I worked with Anwesha, Prathik, and Yougi to develop a trash can that automatically sorts trash using a variety of sensors, an arduino nano, and a servo arm. Since we could not acquire actual capacitive, inductive, or moisture sensors to detect plastic, we used a color sensor for our prototype to communicate the placement of the sensors and how the overall mechanism would work. I helped with the prototype, documentation, and presentation for this project.
  For documentation, I assisted Anwesha in writing a solution summary that provided an in depth description of our product. I focused on calculating the mechanical advantage of the simple machines and describing their significance in our solution. Once Prathik gathered data about the prototype, I used his findings to write a detailed analysis of our current iteration of the design. I also noted issues that were found while testing and identified possible causes and solutions that could be implemented if we had more time and resources. 
	In POE class, I worked with Anwesha to gather materials and build a physical prototype with cardboard and tape. I focused on implementing simple machines to improve the product. This included an inclined plane to send trash down and a “wheel and axle” servo arm. I also helped with planning out our code and making the process efficient in terms of the soft-ware. 
	During the project, we wrestled with the issue of communication. One of our group members did not even answer our messages or view the document until the last day, so the burden was placed on the other members. Moreover, we were unable to set deadlines properly and actually meet them, which led us to cram a lot of work into a few days. Although our prototype worked quite well, it could’ve been better if we had stuck to a solid plan and our gantt chart.

       <h2>Compound Machine Project (POE)</h2>
       <h3>9/17/2021 - 9/28/2021</h3>

        <p>In this project, I worked with four other students to design a compound machine for the fictional company, "Compound". We had to design a functional system that performed an every day task and included at least 4 different types of simple machines. Through the engineering design process, we planned and built a machine that stapled paper using a pulley, first class lever, wedge, and wheel and axle. In this project, I mainly focused on building and testing our design, but I also contributed calculations of the mechanical advantage and documentation. Our group's machine was quite flimsy, especially at the wedge aspect of our system, and we had limitations on materials and time, so this was a major challenge. We overcame this issue by discussing solutions to our issues outside of building and maximizing our in class work time. My group and I also struggled with making our machine function consistently, but we tackled this problem by constantly prototyping solutions and changes. By repeatedly cycling through the design process and communicating issues to my team to ensure the functionality of our machine, I exhibited my ability to persevere and work diligently in a team.</p>

       <h2>Entrepreneurship Project (IED)</h2>
       <h3>5/3/2021 - 5/17/2021</h3> 
      <img src= "images/umbrella.png" alt="profile photo" style = "width:250px;" ALIGN = "right" HSPACE = 15px; />
        <p>In this project, my group and I had 3 weeks to develop a solution to a problem of our choice. Through a design matrix and brainstorming, we decided to generate a solution to inconvenient umbrella designs that made environments slippery. I was the Research Lead and Assistant who found evident flaws in current umbrella designs and presented them to my group. Additionally, I assisted my members in CADing the new umbrella in Autodesk and formally presenting it in a detailed video. My group and I faced issues with communication, since planning a project virtually was extremely difficult, and we had other commitments at that time. I took initiative and solved this by distributing the work and creating a schedule for meetings. Moreover, in order to ensure that our product was truly innovative, we contacted an engineering from an industry professional, Mark Rose. His feedback was very helpful and our teamwork and initiative to get outside help made this project more successful. </p>

       <h2>Lawn Ornament Project (IED)</h2>
       <h3>2/11/2021 - 2/22/2021</h3> 
      <img src= "images/deer.png" alt="profile photo" style = "width:250px;" ALIGN = "right" HSPACE = 15px; />
        <p>In this project, my partner and I were asked to design a visually appealing deer lawn ornament that would be easy for consumers to assemble and place in their front yards. There were weight and material criteria that were crucial to follow for our project. It also had to withstand a 40 pound tipping force, which would be calculated using measurements from out Autodesk (CAD) prototype. My teammate and I decided to stick with a simple yet sturdy deer design that used flat wooden pieces that could be inserted through fitted slits. After extensive research on local deer measurements and recyclable materials, we applied our CAD knowledge to make a proportional deer. However, our deer was too flimsy and small to withstand a 40 lb tipping force, so we repeated the design process multiple times to resize it and utilize new materials. I helped draw initial designs, create multiple versions of the lawn ornament prototype, and document in this project. I came up with quick fixes that were realistic and fit the criteria, which exhibited my ability to problem solve and apply my knowledge to realistic issues. We presented our project in a professional sales pitch that gave step by step instructions on how to assemble the lawn ornament and why people should purchase it.</p>
